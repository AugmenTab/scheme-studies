# scheme-studies

A repository for working through The Little Schemer series, by Daniel P. Friedman and friends.

My aim with reading these books is not necessarily to learn Scheme, though I imagine that will at least partially come as a beneficial side-effect. My primary reason for studying these books is to improve my understanding of the fundamentals of functional programming, and more specifically, recursion, to aid in my efforts to learn Haskell and Clojure.

## The Books

* [The Little Schemer](the-little-schemer.rkt): This book (particularly, the fourth edition) serves as an introduction to Scheme and recursive thinking. I read it to improve my understanding of recursion and functional programming for my studies in Haskell and Clojure. You can [buy it on Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Little-Schemer-Daniel-P-Friedman/dp/0262560992/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=the+little+schemer&qid=1616529506&sr=8-1).
* [The Seasoned Schemer](): My code from following along with this book is coming soon. This book serves as a sequel to "The Little Schemer," and expands upon what was presented in that book. You can [buy it on Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Seasoned-Schemer-MIT-Press/dp/026256100X/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=the+seasoned+schemer&qid=1616529534&s=books&sr=1-1).
* [The Little Typer](): My code from following along with this book is coming soon. This book serves as an introduction to dependent types, which will hopefully be added to Haskell [soon](https://www.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/c3jhq6/whats_the_status_on_dependent_types_in_ghc_as_of/ers0ifl?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3). You can [buy it on Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Little-Typer-MIT-Press/dp/0262536439/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=the+little+typer&qid=1616529610&s=books&sr=1-1).
* [The Reasoned Schemer](): My code from following along with this book is coming soon. This book serves as an introduction to logic programming, using Scheme instead of Prolog. I am reading it in order to understand the basics of logic programming, not only because it will be useful in studying Prolog, but because it will help me [improve at Haskell](https://kseo.github.io/posts/2014-02-17-learning-prolog-to-be-a-better-haskell-programmer.html), and because Clojure has a package [core.logic](https://github.com/clojure/core.logic) that implements logic programming. You can [buy it on Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Reasoned-Schemer-MIT-Press/dp/0262535513/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=the+reasoned+schemer&qid=1616529636&s=books&sr=1-1).
* [The Little Prover](): My code from following along with this book is coming soon. I am reading this less for the benefit of Haskell and Clojure directly, but rather to take a first dive into Hoare logic and using theorems to prove a program's "correctness." You can [buy it on Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Little-Prover-MIT-Press/dp/0262527952/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=the+little+prover&qid=1616529718&s=books&sr=1-1).
